- Restructured :class:`~pmutt.statmech.vib.HarmonicVib` and 
  :class:`~pmutt.statmech.vib.QRRHOVib` classes to calculate vibrational 
  temperatures, scaled wavenumbers and scaled inertia when methods are called 
  (rather than at initialization) to prevent incorrect calculations due to 
  changes in the vibrational wavenumbers.

  :class:`~pmutt.reaction.Reactions`
- Fixed bug related to :class:`~pmutt.empirical.references.References` and

- Restructured code to exclude ``model`` module

Version 1.1.3
-------------
Dec. 11, 2018

- Added :class:`~pmutt.reaction.bep.BEP` class
- Restructured :class:`~pmutt.reaction.Reaction` class so reaction states (i.e.
  reactants, products, transition states) can be calculated separately
- Updated :class:`~pmutt.empirical.references.References` class to be able
  reference any attribute
- Added ``placeholder`` entry to :data:`~pmutt.statmech.presets` dictionary to

- Fixed bugs in :class:`~pmutt.reaction.Reaction` class for calculating
  pre-exponential factors
- Added methods in :class:`~pmutt.reaction.Reaction` class to calculate rate

  :class:`~pmutt.reaction.Reaction` class inputs to be a single pmutt object
  instead of expecting a list

-------------
Nov. 7, 2018

- Fixed bugs in :class:`~pmutt.empirical.shomate.Shomate` class for ``get_HoRT``

  vibrational energies instead of wavenumbers.
