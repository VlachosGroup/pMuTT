!Surface-phase reactions.
!The reaction line has the following format:
!REACTIONS  MW[ON/OFF]   [Ea units]
!where MW stands for Motz-Wise corrections and if the Ea
!units are left blank, then the activation energy should be in cal/mol
!The rate constant expression is:
!k = kb/h/site_den^(n-1) * (T)^beta * exp(-Ea/RT)
!where site_den is the site density and is the number of surface species (including empty sites)
!Each line has 4 columns:
!- Reaction reactants and products separated by =
!- Preexponential factor, kb/h/site_den^(n-1), or 
!  sticking coefficient if adsorption reaction
!- Beta (power to raise T in rate constant expression)
!- Ea (Activation Energy or Gibbs energy of activation in specified units
!Adsorption reactions can be represented using the STICK keyword
